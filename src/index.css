/* 
"wireframe" and "light" themes look clean and professional.
We can implement dark mode later if liked by the users.
But by using daisy UI, we get a coherent look and feel across the app.
And we can change the whole look and feel by changing one word, 
the name of the theme.You can check all of the themes out at the bottom of this link
You can try them out by changing the name of the theme here in this file (index.css).
